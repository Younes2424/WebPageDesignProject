		<h3>Information and Communications Technology</h3>
		<p>Short for ICT, Information and Communications Technology have provided a vast range of inventions and innovations. According to <cite><a href="https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uws.edu.au/docview/2316579850?accountid=36155">Melody and Skinner (2019)</a></cite>, <em>“Communications technologies include the techniques, tools and methods used to facilitate communication, and Information technologies include those used to create, record, modify and display the content being communicated”</em>. <a href="ictcareerstreams.pdf">ICT careers</a> are categorised into four sections: application building, technology services, enterprise governance, and enterprise implication.</p>
		<h3>Software Development</h3>
		<p>My passion for ICT is in software development, and it is my dream and goal to be a skilled software developer. Software development falls under the application building section of <a href="ictcareerstreams.pdf">ICT career streams</a>. According to <cite><a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5227">IBM Research (2014)</a></cite>, <em>“Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software”</em>. In the U.S., 21 percent employment growth is expected from 2018 to 2028 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm"><cite>(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019)</cite></a>. According to user responses from <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-the-demand-for-software-developers-is-decreasing-and-that-there-is-a-saturation-coming-in-this-field">Quora</a>, although demand for software developers is increasing, this is only for skilled and high-quality software developers.</p>
		<h3>Software Development: Requirements</h3>
		<p>Software developers need to have a variety of functional and non-functional skills to be able to succeed in the job market. According to the job advertisements on <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/software-developer-jobs/in-All-Sydney-NSW">Seek</a>, many employers require programmers to know a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, or C++. Having a bachelor’s degree in computer science is a requirement in some of the job advertisements. Software developers also need to acquire non-functional skills such as problem-solving, communication skills, and teamwork skills. <a href="https://www.sfia-online.org/en/framework/sfia-7/skills/solution-development-and-implementation/systems-development/programming-software-development">SFIA</a> – Skills Framework for the Information Age – categorises software development skills into five levels from two to six. Each level has unique responsibilities such as writing simple to complex scripts, testing applications, integration, reviewing own or others’ works, and planning.</p>
		<h3>Contribution</h3>
		<p>In my area of study, as I said before, I am interested in programming and software development because in this area my favourite subjects, mathematics, logic, and computers, come together to solve real-world problems. One of the most recent and interesting concepts in application building is Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Hopefully, by improving my logical and mathematical skills, I will be able to contribute to these new concepts and make the world a better place. According to <cite><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/mathematics-for-ai-all-the-essential-math-topics-you-need-ed1d9c910baf">Parbhakar (2018)</a></cite>, the table below consists of the mathematic subjects essential for Artificial Intelligence:</p>
