		<h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
		<p>Hello, I am Younes Azamiyan, and I will be completing my diploma in Information and Communications Technology from Western Sydney University in February 2021. I have worked in many different industries which allowed me to blend practical skills that I have learned in the past with the theoretical knowledge that I am learning during my studies. I am currently looking for a part-time internship in my area of study to improve my technological skills and to gain practical experience for my future career.<br><br><br></p>
